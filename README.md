## Methodology

1. **Data Upload:**  
   Uploaded the transaction dataset containing fields like InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Dropped records with missing CustomerIDs.
   - Removed negative quantities indicating product returns.
   - Created a new feature: `TotalPrice = Quantity Ã— UnitPrice`.

3. **Feature Aggregation:**  
   Grouped data at the customer level to calculate:
   - Number of orders
   - Total quantity purchased
   - Total amount spent

4. **Feature Scaling:**  
   Applied StandardScaler to normalize the feature space.

5. **Clustering:**  
   - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Implemented KMeans clustering with the optimal number of clusters (4).

6. **Visualization:**  
   Visualized the customer clusters using a scatter plot with spending and quantity axes.
